# Functional lite with kyle sympson

# What is it?
This is just details what i learnt reading kyle sympson book on [functioal programming] (https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS).  It will also evolve into my notes as I explore functional programming, more specfically in javascript.

# Goal
The whole idea is that, by going the extra mile to document what i learn, I will get the opportunity to really understand the subject as introduced in the book and much more.
